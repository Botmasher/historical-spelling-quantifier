# Historical Spelling Quantifier

Determine how closely a language's spelling system matches its basic phonology. Take in data containing a bunch of words with both orthographic and phonemic form. Determine the likelihood that certain orthographic letters map to certain phones across words, then score possible interpretations of sound-spelling mappings to find the most charitable and most likely interpretations of deviation between sound and spelling for individual words and the dataset (language) as a whole.

## Getting Started

Currently fleshing out a version in Python 3 run from `main.py`. I'll add notes here once things go somewhere.

## Contributing

This is a project built out in Python to solve a personal curiosity; it won't get much attention beyond some early tinkering. You're welcome to contribute or use it as a springboard for your own projects.
